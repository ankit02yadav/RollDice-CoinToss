# 🎲 NumPy Simulation Projects 

This repository contains two beginner-friendly simulation projects created using **NumPy** in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment. The goal of these projects is to explore basic probability concepts through simulations.

## 📌 Project 1: Dice Roll Simulation

This project simulates rolling a 6-sided die **10,000 times**. It uses NumPy to generate random outcomes and counts how often each face (1 through 6) appears.

### What You'll Learn:
- How to use NumPy's random number generation.
- How to count occurrences of outcomes.
- Basics of probability through simulation.

---

## 📌 Project 2: Coin Toss Probability

This project simulates **1,000,000 coin tosses**, randomly choosing between heads and tails. The counts of each outcome are tracked to check how close the results are to an even 50/50 probability.

### What You'll Learn:
- How to simulate binary outcomes.
- How large sample sizes behave in probability.
- Applying simple logic to interpret data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run each cell to view the simulation in action.
